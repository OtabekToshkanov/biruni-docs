# OAuth2

Biruni's OAuth2 authorization system operates at two distinct levels:

1. System-level authorization: Tokens generated by system-level clients can be used across any company within the system.
2. Company-level authorization: Tokens generated by company-level clients are restricted to use only within their specific company.
