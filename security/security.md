# Securing Application

This section outlines the security mechanisms of the Biruni framework, designed to ensure secure access and authentication across web applications, mobile applications, APIs, and license management. The framework provides a comprehensive set of tools and protocols to protect user interactions, data, and system resources, tailored to diverse platforms and use cases.

## Overview

The Biruni framework's security system is engineered to authenticate and authorize users, external services, and licensed features effectively. It supports multiple authentication and authorization methods depending on the platform and purpose:

* **Cookie-based sessions** for web applications.
* **Token-based authentication** for mobile applications
* **OAuth2-based authorization** for securing API access and managing company-level server clients.
* **License management** to enforce access control and validate software usage through activation and assignment.

The security configurations are organized into four key areas:

* **Web**
* **Mobile**
* **OAuth2**
* **Licensing**
